# Steering Mechanic Demo

## Author
Alex/EnDarke

## Quick Note
I could very well just use Roblox's built in VectorForce, AlignOrientation,
AlignPosition, etc. objects, but that's no fun! :D

## Objective
Create a demo where players can place nodes to create a track for a little ship to follow along.

## About
Steering Behaviors for Autonomous Characters. Originally proposed by, "Craig W. Reynolds"

## Summary
Steering Behaviors for Autonomous Characters is an algorithm that grants the ability for characters to find their way to a location excluding character's knowledge of locomotion. Through "steering," it allows us to avoid objects, follow paths, and "flock" with other objects. This algorithm covers a lot of ground in terms of extendable possibilities. However, I will only be going for a simple path-following system through this algorithm.

## Algorithm
### Short Description
There are a four key steps that are necessary for this algorithm to work. These would include: `seek and flee`, `pursuit and evasion`, `offset pursuit`, and of course `arrival`.

### How will it need to be implemented?
- **Seek and Flee:** This will adjust the velocity of the character that way it is aligned towards the given position or target.
- **Pursuit and Evasion:** Similar to seek and flee, but this allows us to calculate the potential future position of the target as if it were moving. This way, we are able to catch them whilst moving.
- **Offset Pursuit:**
