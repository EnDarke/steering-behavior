**Steering Mechanic Demo**

Author:
    Alex/EnDarke

Quick Note:
    I could very well just use Roblox's built in VectorForce, AlignOrientation,
    AlignPosition, etc. objects, but that's no fun! I want to challenge myself :D

Objective:
    Create a demo where players can place nodes to create a track for a
    little ship to follow along.

Algorithm:
    - Steering Behaviors originally proposed by, "Craig W. Reynolds"
